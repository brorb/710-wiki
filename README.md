Hi.
## Quartz site

The `quartz-site/` directory contains the Quartz static-site generator that renders this vault. To build locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build script installs dependencies within `quartz-site/` and the generated site appears in `quartz-site/public/`.

## Railway deployment

Railway reads `railway.toml` to build and serve the site:

- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`

Connect this repository to a Railway service that honors `railway.toml`; the service will run the build script (which installs and builds Quartz) and serve the generated `quartz-site/public/` directory.
