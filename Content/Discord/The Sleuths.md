A group of investigators trying to solve the many mysterious surrounding the [[710 Tone]] YouTube channel. 

The group was created by brorb on the 2nd July 2025 after chatters in the then ongoing 7/10 livestreams voiced interest for a community of "sleuthers".

Our goal is to study and archive all content produced by 7/10.
