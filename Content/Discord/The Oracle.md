The Oracle is a Discord bot made by @brorb for [[The Sleuths]] Discord server. It is connected directly to the wiki and is able to use all existing data here to answer any questions. To use it, simply type 
```
!ask <query>
```
either in a channel on the Discord server, or in a DM to the bot.

Like any LLM, the Oracle can be wrong at times, so make sure to not over-rely on it.
It does not handle image generation or image analysis (yet!).
