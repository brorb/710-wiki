# Welcome to the 7/10 Tone Sleuth Wiki!

This is a community-driven wiki project driven by the [[The Sleuths]] and is not officially affiliated with the ARG known as [[7/10 Tone]]. 

This wiki exists as a tool for young and old sleuths alike, in order to quickly navigate the (sometimes overwhelming) lore of the 7/10 universe. Here, you will find:

- Summaries of characters, factions, channels, and major events.
- Puzzles and canvases tracked by the community.
- Timelines and transcripts for livestreams, videos, and community findings.

## Keep exploring
