**Video Summary:** [[INDI]] LOG, garbled text on the bottom of the screen with the red and black static. Strange faint noises in the background under the intense static noise, and also at various points in the video there are a muffled voices, like someone talking or singing. The [[Station Timer]] sound also plays faintly in the background at the beginning and end of the video. Timer counts down from 051 to 050.

**Clues:** The audio could be a mix of radio station broadcasts and other types of frequencies.
