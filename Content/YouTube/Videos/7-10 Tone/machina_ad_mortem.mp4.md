**Video Summary:** Starts off with a glitchy grayscale screen, then a console terminal is accessed, which gets an input to purge the system. A red and black box pops up with the words "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? WE CAN STILL FIX THIS! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! IT HURTS!" then it cuts to black until the terminal loads itself again and slowly reinstalls the Operating System and its components while some frequencies softly hum in the background. After it finally finishes reinstalling, the program loads up with the glitching text "ATTEMPTING CONNECTION" while data noises play out in the background, then it finally connects and the rest of the video acts as an "unmarked" LOG. Normal red and black static plays, then the timer morphs from 130 to 129.
