**Video Summary:** Unlike all the previous LOGs, this one has no LOG data screen or red and black static, instead it starts off with a computer program that looks like an old-school Atari video game, with two humanoids and what looks like two towers that move around the screen, the term "ord", and a menu flashes with two interchangeable options (first is "Resume", "Settings", and "Quit", the second is "Controls", "Audio", and "Display"). The audio of the "game" is a loud 8-bit like noise. The screen cuts to black, which fades into some glitchy red before black slowly wipes away the red color. Then the [[Station Interruption]] briefly comes on before a loud 8-bit tune sounds off, then a terminal comes on and lists some files that are all infected (red flashing text "CRITICAL WARNING ALL INFECTED"), the text "INFECTED BY LONG STRING" gets printed repeatedly on-screen until it lags the computer to a crawl. [[TTH]] logo can be briefly seen in the bottom corner before the [[Station Interruption]] scene comes on and lasts for the rest of the video.
