###### Video Summary:
LOG data screen glitches out, showing various data screens which overlap on each other, then [[The Eyes]] appear onscreen before it freezes, then cuts to the [[Station Interruption]] screen, which plays for about 2 minutes until it cuts to the [[Station Timer]], set to 162 days, 3 hours and 32 minutes. A male radio presenter talks in the background, announcing the time in UTC within certain intervals, and according to him the station is WWV located in Fort Collins, Colorado, and broadcasts internationally-allocated standard stereo frequencies of 2.5, 5, 15, and 20 mHz, providing the time of day, standard time interval, and "other related information" of such. The number 30 (colored red) flashes for a split second before the video ends.
