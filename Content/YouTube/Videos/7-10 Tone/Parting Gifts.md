**Video Summary:** Starts off with a black screen and some frequencies, then it shows the following items: a gray image, a rotating red kaleidoscope, a red blinking image that folds out (dividing by two triangles), a warping white screen then a white and black checkerboard that is also warping. Some data is then sent to a "TTH SERVERLINE", then the text "I WILL DO IT ALL AGAIN" types out then glitches with some loud banging noises. [[Channel 14]]'s screen appears, then images from the [[Hello]] video, [[LOG-116.mp4]], the [[Station Interruption]] scene (twice), [[LOG-156.mp4]], then [[Long String]] are all overlayed upon red and black static from [[The Logs]]. The video then freezes and ends.

**Clues:** The phrase "I WILL DO IT ALL AGAIN" could suggest that the events relating to [[710 Tone]] will happen once again next year, making the channel an annual event.
