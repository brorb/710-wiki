**Video Summary:** Features [[prj_Home.exe]], which glitches and distorts as the player walks around in a strange matter. The video cuts around until they finally enter the house, ending up in a red room similar to the one in [[backtone.extend 5_f''5.5'']]. As they try to turn around, the video freezes and glitches, with the words "UNABLE TO PROCESS" repeating over and over again until the video ends.

**Clues:** The title could be a cipher of some sort. Also, this version of prj_home is different than the one [[The Sleuths]] received from the [[Parting Gifts Puzzle.canvas|Parting Gifts Puzzle]], not only is it glitchy and features the red room instead of a blue room, but the player character also has a shadow (it's a little hard to see due to the distorted view of the camera).
