**Video Summary:** Starts off with an update being performed, with the text "updating please hold" on the blue screen while a dial tone can be briefly heard as the screen cuts to black. Then the text "UPDATE COMPLETE" flash on the top of the screen before the video ends.

**Clues:** This is possibly an update for whatever program makes [[The Logs]].
