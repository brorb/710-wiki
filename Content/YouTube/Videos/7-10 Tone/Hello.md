**Video Summary:** Introduction video to what [[710 Tone]] is all about. According to the owner, the channel uploads LOGs from a program that is designed to pull data from "Caper Waves" (unofficial term), which could possibly be a type of signal or radio wave. They are ordered by someone to make the program and upload the videos to the channel for an unknown purpose, keeping things very secret as to what the purpose of it is and exactly *who* the mysterious people are that force them to do this. They ask the viewers to make the channel go viral before signing off. The video then cuts to the number 100, which quickly scans through numbers and morphs into the number 099. Then a distorted old-timey song plays in the background while a "LINX-OS TERMINAL 8" screen (similar to MS-DOS) appears onscreen, which loads some LOG output and tries to send the data to the C: drive, but errors out due to limited storage space, then someone attempts to mount an "E" drive, removing the C: drive, but the "E" drive also has low storage as well.

Hello
The 7/10 Tone Channel
I see you.
_(Shows a ton of comments)_
All of you.
You where recommended this channel.
And rightfully have some questions.
No, I'm not him.
No, I'm not REN.
No, I do not make the logs, but I do upload them.
Yes, this is the real channel owner.
I am not a corporate entity or organization looking to recruit people.
I don't like to get involved with this channel, but the recent 100+ sub count has made me concerned for where it is going.
So...
What is 7/10 Tone exactly?
7/10 Tone is a program that is disigned to pull data from Caper Waves (Not official term).
Don't get it?
Me neither.
I did not design the program, I was told to make it by someone.
Those people won't be named.
So, why do I upload these to YouTube?
The 7/10 Tone program runs on an external computer that records and stores the logs.
This can take up a lot of space, more than 1TB of I kept them all.
So, I asked if I can modify the program so it would upload to youtube instead, and they agreed.
That is why you're seeing them being posted to the 7/10 Tone channel.
If, you found this channel by accident, congratulations, you have the strangest YouTube algorithm known to man.
But, I need you to do something.
All of you.
I need you to unsubscribe to this channel. 
(Message gets edited quickly)
I need you to subscribe and share this channel.
(Message gets edited again crudely)
I need you to make this channel viral.
I hope you can understand why.
And with that, goodbye for now.
