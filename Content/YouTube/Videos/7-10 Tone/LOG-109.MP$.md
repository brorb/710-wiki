**LOG: 87189184
SYSTEM: 532989
SYSTEM ID: 523548416**

**Description:** IN_DI\servertype

**Video Summary:** The first LOG that features [[INDI]], who talks through slow typing text while some frequencies play out in the background. He attempts to a file send (it's not specified as to what this file actually is, but it could possibly be [[Long String]] or another type of file), but the screen cuts to red with static and goes black for about 16 seconds before returning to the normal red and black static. Timer counts down from 082 to 081.
