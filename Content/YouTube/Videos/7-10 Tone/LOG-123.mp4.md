###### Video Summary: 
Video starts with some colored static and some low-pitched bit-tune before it freezes and the colors red and blue flash, then it cuts to a terminal that is connecting to a calling server or "chatroom", with two characters "SS" and "CLS" conversing with each other. CLS had to purge their terminal due to [[Long String]] and asks SS for help on how to get rid of it without purging the terminal again, but before SS can help with their predicament the computer gets infected with Long String. The antenna logo appears in the corner of the screen as the text disappears, then the video begins as a normal LOG, with the red and black static and the flashing antenna in the corner. Timer counts down from 

**Clues:** The server's latitude and longitude coordinates are shown briefly before the terminal connects to the chat:

**server lat: \[end:38, end:392]
server long: \[end:29, end:392]**
