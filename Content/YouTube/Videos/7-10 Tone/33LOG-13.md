**Description:** Oh, well this is very interesting... Well it was just too easy not to.

**Video Summary:** Red and black static just like any other LOG, except the audio is replaced with an edited version of [Serenade for Winds in D Minor, Op. 44: Moderato quasi marcia] that repeats on loop throughout the video (even through the [[Station Timer]]). The word "OFFLINE" replaces the garbled text that usually appears whenever [[INDI]] is connected, and the antenna logo in the corner is red instead of white, indicating that INDI might be disconnected (or "offline").
