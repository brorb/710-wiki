**Video Summary:** Beginning part cuts out a little, then a terminal pops up while some mechanical scanning noises play for a little bit, then the logo for [[Ferkland Institute]] comes on screen with the words "FUNDED DEATH" repeating on screen and loud noises, then the [[Station Timer]] beeps play out for a bit before getting cut off by another mechanical noise (similar to the one near the end of the [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]] livestream where [[INDI]] was found). The video is black and silent until 1:09, when the normal red and black static plays out. Timer counts down from 086 to 085.

**Clues:** The Institute could have been involved in some shady practices that inherently caused some causalities.
