**Video Summary:** A flashing image of a white strip over a black background and a red "L" shape in the left side of the screen while a beeping noise plays on loop (which is possibly a type of signal wave).

**Clues:** The description could be some .op files (OpenPAT or eSignal), which possibly point to some coordinates.
