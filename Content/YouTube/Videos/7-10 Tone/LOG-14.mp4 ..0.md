**Video Summary:** Normal red and black static with a weird "tone" sound in the left audio channel playing near the beginning, which gets gradually louder until it stops at 0:21. Timer counts down from 145 to 144 with audio that sounds like some kind of low-pitced ventilation knocking that gets cut off by a beeping noise.
