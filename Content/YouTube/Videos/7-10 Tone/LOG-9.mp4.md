**LOG: 839573948
SYSTEM: 472918 
SYSTEM ID: 672020284**

**Video Summary:** LOG data screen shows up for 2-3 seconds (much like in [[LOG-008.mp4]]), audio is slightly muffled/lower quality, red and black static plays as normal, timer counts down from 150 to 149.

**Clues:** Similar to LOG-008.mp4, the timer sound is slowed speech saying the number eight(?).
