**Video Summary:** Normal red and black static, timer morphs from 160 to 159 with text in the bottom left corner flashing "2nd opened" (see clue below).

**Clues:** The comments of this video on YouTube contained the following exchange between [[710 NPP]] and [[710 Tone]]:

==710NPP:== BIN APPLICATION COMPLETE
==7/10 Tone:== INITIALIZE BIN 0002 in \*\*\*\,*\*\,\*

This could mean that a file was being exchanged by between two entities, which could be some in relation to [[0001 Bin]] (which was uploaded on the same day). The text at the bottom corner while the timer changes numbers could relate this to 2nd BIN file, with the timer acting as a sort of "code" for it... possibly.
