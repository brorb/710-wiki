**Video Summary:** The video features a small red room slowly forming onscreen, then after it finishes four black arrows pop up with a beep, pointing in four different directions (forward, backward, left and right). Another beep sounds and the camera slowly moves forward in the room, then the arrows appear again and the left option is chosen, moving the camera to the left side of the room where a painting of Leonardo DaVinci can be seen on the wall. The arrows pop up onscreen one last time with another beep, but this time with a white arrow pointing forward to "inspect" with the painting (much like in a video game). After inspecting the painting, the camera moves to the left again, and the words "QUANDO NATUS EST" appear onscreen with a robotic voice reading out the words.

**Clues:** The term "QUANDO NATUS EST" is in Latin, translated as "When he was born." Leonardo DaVinci was born on 15 April, 1452.
