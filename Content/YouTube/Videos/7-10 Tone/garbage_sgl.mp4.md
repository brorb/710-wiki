**Video Summary:** Starts off with some glitchy visuals and audio, which get more intense as a low-pitched screechy noise fades in until it cuts to an image of a red square outline over a black background and the words "INITIALIZING" on the left side of the outline. The intro to Channel 14 pops up and then shows the schedule (see below), before it distorts and the background music slows down, then it freezes and cuts to static.
