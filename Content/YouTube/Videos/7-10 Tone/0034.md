**Video Summary:** The screen test output timer from the end of [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]], which is partially covered by a red-ish bar. Distorted text in the top corner dances on screen ("prj_rig NOT ACCEPTED at value 12"), with the words "LIVE: FALSE" occasionally flashing on screen in the same corner as the distorted text. At around 1:58, the words "?EVILA UOY ERA" appear on screen for a split second, which spell "ARE YOU ALIVE?" backwards.
