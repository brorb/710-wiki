###### Video Summary: 
LOG data PORT-CALL is set to deactivated with new data below, [[INDI]] finally connects and some garbled text appears under the red and black static. At around one minute, the sound glitches and then a dial tone can be heard with the text "EXTERNAL MIC ERROR" on the top of the screen, then some beeping and frequencies can be heard for the rest of the video. At around 2 minutes, the text on the bottom stops changing until it starts typing itself again at around 8 minutes. Timer counts down from 059 to 058.
