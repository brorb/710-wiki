**Video Summary:** Starts off with the text "\*analyzing data bump 7766\*" with loud raw data noises, then shows some images on screen with a low-pitched voice reading out some kind of code (or possibly URL). A dark image with a circle in the top right corner and then a skyline (which is actually an image of an unknown remote area on the road) appear on-screen. Then the words "STICHING" glitch out with some loud noise, then cuts to a picture of a smiling woman's portrait. The glitchy words "STICHING" appear once again with the loud sine noise, then a reversed text-to-speech voice reads out something, then a grayscale glitchy image with red text reading "I will help you!" appear on-screen, then the text-to-speech voice reads out what sounds like an URL normally.

**Clues:** The URL read from the text to speech voice no longer works. However, there is another possible URL read out by the lower-pitched voice.
