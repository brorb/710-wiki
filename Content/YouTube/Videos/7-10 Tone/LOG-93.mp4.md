**Video Summary:** Higher contrast video quality, red and black static starts out as normal until a mouse cursor briefly flies across towards the top right corner of the screen, then a blue bar with nearly indecipherable text pops up on the very top of the screen while a soft screechy tone plays in the background over the rest of the static. The mouse cursor can be seen occasionally around the right side of the screen. Timer counts down from 098 to 097, the number "7" in 097 repeats itself, going diagonally downwards on the screen, which cuts out to red with some data noise.

**Clues:** It seems like whoever is in charge of the program that makes [[The Logs]] tried to "feed" it some kind of data, judging by what little could be deciphered from the blue bar's text: **"(?????) (?????) DATA DETECTED"**
