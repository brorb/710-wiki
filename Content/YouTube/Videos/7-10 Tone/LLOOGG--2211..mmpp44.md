**LOG: 462891984
SYSTEM: 392047
SYSTEM ID: 0392873370**

**Video Summary:** LOG data screen sound is super low-pitched, red and black static plays out like normal with quiet background noise, timer counts down from 170 to 169 with a horizontal line of zeros parallel to the numbers and a noise that's similar to the one at the beginning of [[LOG-116.mp4]].
