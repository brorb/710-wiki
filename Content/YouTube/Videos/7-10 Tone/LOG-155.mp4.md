**Video Summary:** Starts off with the Channel 14 intro repeating itself with the words "NO AUDIO" in the top left corner of the screen, then it cuts to the standard [[INDI]] LOG, red and black static with the antenna logo and garbled text at the bottom of the screen and distorted music can be heard under all the noise. Timer counts down from 036 to 035 with the [[Station Timer]] beeps softly audible.
