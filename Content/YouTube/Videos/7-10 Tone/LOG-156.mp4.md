**Video Summary:** Last [[INDI]] LOG, loud noise in the beginning of the normal red and black static with antenna and garbled text on the bottom of the screen. More distorted music in the background under the heavy noise, at around 3:27 another brief loud noise happens, then at around 4:54 an 8-bit "pew" sound can be heard. Timer counts down from 036, 035, to 034 while the [[Station Timer]] quietly beeps in the background.
