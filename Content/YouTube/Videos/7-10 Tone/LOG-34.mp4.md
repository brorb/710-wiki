**LOG: 738920182

SYSTEM ID: 361940924**

**Video Summary:** Higher contrast LOG data screen, normal red and black static until around 3:46 where an alarm goes off with flashing text in the top left corner of the screen. The noise dies down and gets replaced by ominous industrial sounds, which gradually get louder and almost "ghostlier", almost like something mysterious is stalking an echo-y area. At around 5:53 the static freezes, then timer counts down from 158 to 157 with some strange noises playing in the background.

**Clues:** The alarm sounds are similar to [[vacsystemrestart.mp3]] (which was created the very next day: 4 Feb 2025), and the top text refers to some kind of "heat control component" deactivating, which could be for the machine that runs the program to make [[The Logs]].
