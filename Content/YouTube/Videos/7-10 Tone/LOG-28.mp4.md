**Video Summary:** Normal red and black static with quiet background noise, at around 0:46 the audio fades out and an image with a repeating tile of faces flashes on-screen before the video comes back to normal (except the background noise is louder this time). Timer counts down from 165 to 164 while strange beeping noises play in the background.

**Clues:** The faces that appear for a flash look similar to the woman seen in [[TRANSLATED-DD.PCV]].
