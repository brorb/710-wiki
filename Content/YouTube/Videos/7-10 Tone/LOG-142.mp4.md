**Video Summary:** [[INDI]] LOG, normal red and black static with antenna and garbled text on the bottom of the screen, noise seems to be a slight continuation from [[LOG-141.mp4]] judging by the muffled speech in the beginning, with more distorted speech, music, and radio frequencies in the background. At around 6:15, the background noise becomes a little less intense and gradually becomes similar to the sounds of the previous LOGs, before some more distorted music comes back at around 9:33. Timer counts down from 049 to 048.
