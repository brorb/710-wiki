**Video Summary:** [[INDI]] log, normal red and black static with a flashing antenna logo in the bottom corner, at 4:30 the antenna briefly flashes on the screen with the word "INFECTED" repeating over it, then the video proceeds as normal. Timer morphs from 080 to 079 (silent and subtly).

**Clues:** INDI could have been infected with a virus and switched over to working for [[REN]].
