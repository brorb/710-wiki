**Video Summary:** Video starts with Channel 14 intro with the words "NO AUDIO" in the top left corner of the screen, then shows the "UP NEXT" schedule. The screen briefly distorts when the third part of the schedule appears, then it comes back to normal and some frequencies (with some brief morse code in the beginning) in the background, before showing the final part of the schedule and fading to Channel 14 intro again. The Log then begins as normal, with more distorted music and radio frequencies with the antenna and garbled text under the red and black static. Timer counts down from 037 to 036, with the [[Station Timer]] beeps a little more clearly audible.
