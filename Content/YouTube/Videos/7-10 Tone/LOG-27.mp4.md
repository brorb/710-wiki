**Video Summary:** Beginning is very low-pitched, normal red and black static for about 8 seconds before it cuts to a dark scene with an arrangement of [[The Eyes]] while a "growling" sound plays in the background, then the screen cuts to black while some radio frequencies and strange noises can be heard in the background for the rest of the video.

**Clues:** The audio during the "Eyes" section and when it cuts to black (the radio frequencies) is slowed down and reversed. The first section is speech that repeatedly says "It happens, it happened...", while the second section has various radio stations being skipped, some partial audio from [[30]], some strange beeping noises, and what sounds like someone talking over an intercom.
