**Video Summary:** The video starts with text reading "DUMPING EXTRACTED DATA: BIN # # I9976900, then some strange glitchy noise appears and it cuts to black. Then a sequence of four numbers (all the same) with the words "True" and "False" appear, with the numbers cycling through 0-9 as a data-like noises play in the background. At the end of the video, the word "True" is only thing visible for a brief moment.
