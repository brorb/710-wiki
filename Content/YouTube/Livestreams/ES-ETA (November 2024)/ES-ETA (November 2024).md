**Summary:** Screen with four different colored squares and illegible text, which is occasionally broken up by a screen with binary text and mechanical computer sounds. At around 30 minutes into the stream, 7/10 Tone posts a comment in the chat which is in reverse. It says an ESPaP station calls for all residents of "Quarter A-87" to be re-evaluated to another quarter. Eventually, another comment from 7/10 Tone gets posted that is also reversed, saying that a system is in now effect.
