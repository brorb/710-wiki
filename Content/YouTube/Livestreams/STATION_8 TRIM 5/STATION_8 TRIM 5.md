This is the summary of the livestream "STATION_8 TRIM 5", from July 4th 2025

[[Travis]] (who is control of the [[710 Tone]] channel) communicates with [[INDI]] (who is in control of the [[710 NPP]] channel) through chat. INDI tells Travis that he has "one last job" to do before he perishes from the [[Black Mold]], then asks him when he escaped from somewhere. Travis says that he was "never apart of the complex", which [[INDI]] replies that he's very lucky that he wasn't and then apologizes to Travis that he left. [[INDI]] also says that "testing confirms that this one will destroy another", which could mean a base or something else but isn't clearly specified. Stream goes out due to some kind of technical difficulty then restarts.

During the restart, [[Travis]]' condition worsens with the [[Black Mold]] spreading to his lungs, then [[Kepler]] sends [[Travis]] an apology through [[INDI]], to which [[Travis]] takes responsibility for what had happened and that he doesn't want anyone else except for "them" (not specified as to who or what "they" are) to be blamed for it. [[Travis]] hands over control of the [[710 Tone]] channel to [[INDI]], who forbodes him farewell ("SLEEP WELL TRAVIS").

Stream proceeds as normal until an interference ([[Station Interruption]] screen) comes on, which [[INDI]] eventually fixes. He announces to [[Travis]] that he fixed it, until he quickly realizes that he's gone. The viewers greet [[INDI]] and try to get his attention, but [[INDI]] says that he's not allowed to talk to them. However, [[INDI]] does answer a couple of questions, he reveals that he "took care of the mold" and that [[Travis]] was a scientist before he says he has to stop talking.

Stream proceeds again as normal, with some minor occasional interferences along the way. Although, eventually [[INDI]] has to restart the stream due to an interference from [[REN]].
