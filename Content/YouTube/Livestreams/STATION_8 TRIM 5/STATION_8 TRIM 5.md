This is the summary of the livestream "STATION_8 TRIM 5", from July 4th 2025

[[Travis]] operates [[710 Tone]] during this stream while critically ill from [[Black Mold]] exposure. The mold has reached his lungs, and he states he might not survive the evening. [[Kepler]] sends an apology through [[710 NPP]] (seemingly operated by [[INDI]] or a similar entity that types in all caps), but [[Travis]] insists it's not [[Kepler]]'s faultâ€”he wasn't careful enough. [[Travis]] specifically wants only "them" (unspecified) to be blamed for the incident. He describes feeling cold and tired before transferring control of [[710 Tone]] to [[INDI]], who responds "SLEEP WELL TRAVIS."

After [[INDI]] takes over [[710 Tone]], they report fixing something for [[Travis]] and handling the [[Black Mold]]. When viewers ask questions, [[INDI]] states they're not allowed to communicate with the audience. [[INDI]] confirms that [[Travis]] was a scientist. Technical difficulties follow, requiring a stream restart.
