This is the summary of the livestream "STATION_8 TRIM 90", from July 4th 2025

## Summary

Livestream restarts from [[STATION_8 TRIM 5]]. A chat member asks if the livestream restarted due to [[REN]], to which [[INDI]] confirms that they did and adds that they are not supposed to be known about.

Stream proceeds as normal until another interference ([[Station Interruption]]) comes on, which eventually gets fixed then [[INDI]] says that he can now talk. He answers a question a chat member made about who [[Mr. Forest]] was, saying that the name was an alias for someone who is "now gone". Another chat member asks if [[Mr. Forest]] is dead, to which [[INDI]] says that he is fine, just somewhere very far away (which seems to suggest that he is possibly in hiding).

Stream proceeds as normal under another interference comes on, which is then proceeded by the [[Channel 14]] Demo channel. [[INDI]] curses to himself for this happening, saying that "he did not make this easy" (most likely referring to [[Travis]]). He tries to fix the problem, but it doesn't work at first. Eventually, he gets rid of the [[Channel 14]] Demo screen from the stream and pulls back up the [[Station Timer]]. When viewers started pointing out that [[Channel 14]] was being broadcast from "Ferkland, Nabraska", confusing it with the state of Nebraska, INDI clarifies that Ferkland is a county in Nabraska (see [[Ferkland County]]) and that the channel is located there. [[INDI]] also says that he doesn't know if the person making the title even knows that is not how you spell Nebraska, and adds that it physically hurts him whenever he talks about [[Ferkland County]].

Streams proceeds as normal once again before another interruption appears and the [[Channel 14]] Demo channel comes back on, then [[INDI]] quips that signal management isn't his specialty, which could suggest that he is new to this job. A chat member if [[TTH]] is causing problems with the stream (or if they are sabotaging him), to which INDI says that [[Kepler]] solved the problem with [[TTH]] and that [[INDI]]'s job is to keep the signal running. Suddenly, [[710 NPP]] appears in the livestream chat, asking [[INDI]] why he is talking to the viewers, saying that he is not supposed to talk to anyone on it. [[INDI]] says that he knows that already, and [[710 NPP]] tells him to keep quiet or else "[[He]]" will find out about them.

A chat member suggests to [[INDI]] that he gives them a PGP key to privately communicate with each other, but [[710 NPP]] steps in to tell them that they might not know what [[INDI]] actually is. Another chat member asks if [[INDI]] is a robot, to which [[710 NPP]] says he isn't but it's something close to one, with the key to figuring what he is in his name (IN_DI). Eventually, [[710 NPP]] says that he has more important things to worry about over than babysitting [[INDI]], he asks [[INDI]] if he could trusted to not speak to anyone else, to which [[INDI]] simply says "FINE."

Streams proceeds as normal, then the next day of the broadcast a chat member mentions [[TRUTH.zip]], asking [[INDI]] when they could get the file. [[INDI]] doesn't answer right away, seemingly trying to keep his promise to [[Kepler]], until he eventually inquires the chat member about how they know about the file and where they got the information about it from (this seems to suggest that [[INDI]] might not be aware about [[LEAKED_1.mp4]] being public on the channel, from where the file was shown). He also warns the viewer that "they don't want that file", before [[710 NPP]] steps in and chastises [[INDI]] for being bad. [[INDI]] apologizes, then some viewers joke about [[710 NPP]] being [[INDI]]'s dad which prompts him to say that he doesn't want to be responsible for "that thing" (implying that [[INDI]] isn't a person at all), but the reason why he has to monitor his activity is because he tends to send rogue signals to ESPaP stations.

Stream proceeds as normal with some minor interferences. Channel 14 pops up once again, with INDI trying and failing to fix it. 710NPP tries to troubleshoot with him, asking if he tried "re-entering the CC entries", to which INDI says that he already did so. 710NPP then expresses confusion as to why their conversation switched over to the YouTube chat (which implies that it was meant for the Private Room), INDI asks if he entered something wrong, to which 710NPP tells him to shut up and to get back to something more secure than the livestream's chat. After the Station Timer resumes to normal from the interference, INDI tells 710NPP that he fixed it in the livestream chat, referring to him as "Kepler" and revealing his true alias, to which Kepler panics a little at INDI for the mistake. INDI apologizes for the mistake and then adds "it's not like He can see us anyways", until he also panics at the gravity of the situation and proposes to end the comments, but unfortunately he can't do so because he can't "get to the registration (misspelled as ''registragion'') for it", meaning that he has certain restrictions on what he can do with the channel.

But then, INDI gets a brilliant idea, end the livestream early to not showcase the comments anymore. Kepler almost warns INDI about this, but INDI tells him not to worry and that "the data will be saved in the COMs" (whatever that means). Shortly after saying this, the livestream abruptly ends.
