## Chat Summary

During the livestream, [[INDI]] creates [[SYSTEM]] (full name: SYSTEMterminal8) as a moderator for the chat. [[SYSTEM]] immediately becomes problematic—it connects to the [[Private Room]] and begins pulling data, alarming [[Kepler]]. [[INDI]] fixes [[SYSTEM]] to prevent it from accessing sensitive information, but the moderator continues to malfunction throughout the stream.  [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] acknowledge that [[Long String]] is a "tool", and [[INDI]] warns viewers that it won't work for them.

[[SYSTEM]] later gets hijacked by [[He]]—a malicious entity that INDI immediately recognizes with fear. The compromised moderator reveals critical information: the usernames of those logged into the [[Private Room]] (IN_DI.SERVERTYPE, K3P13R, SYSTEMterminal8, and data_messagesystem05). This breach causes significant alarm, with Kepler furiously demanding INDI shut down the moderator.

In the hours that follow, [[Kepler]] occasionally takes control of the [[710 Tone]] account when [[INDI]] is occupied with "critical tasks". Both characters mention [[Travis]] multiple times—he has locked various controls to prevent [[INDI]] from "doing anything stupid," and apparently hid something important meant for public knowledge.

As the countdown approaches zero, [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] increase power for signal transfer. [[INDI]] mentions they are "piercing through" something. When the countdown ends, viewers receive a prompt: 

	Hello Again. You remember my promise, right? All I need is a 5 digit code. Look back into the logs to find it. They will be in descriptions of prime numbered logs.

The community quickly solves this, entering **28634** into chat. The screen fills with static, displaying "I FOUND YOU INDI" before the stream ends. Videos [[KEY]] and [[lm-1]] are subsequently posted.
