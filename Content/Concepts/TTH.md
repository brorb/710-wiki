They are an organization who perform some sort of transmission, and [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] fork for them. It is not known whether they are a government institution or a private one. They have numerous people working for them, as indicated by the [[Private Room]] chats.

It is known that TTH is a subbranch of some other organization.<!-- discord-cite:cite-mgqtc9qs-494koo -->

It is likely that TTH are the ones responsible for [[The Logs]] being made. This is known because in the livestream chat of [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]], [[INDI]] states that the logs were made by "The [\_\_\_]", which likely refers to TTH. 


Their logo feature two hands on a red background. The hands are a symbolization of human work.<!-- discord-cite:cite-mgqt94ga-p0y1ah -->
