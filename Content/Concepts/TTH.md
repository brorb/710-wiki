TTH stands for "The Transmitting Hands", sometimes abbreviated to "Transmitting Hands"[^1]
. 
They are an organization who perform some sort of transmission, and [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] fork for them. It is not known whether they are a government institution or a private one. They have numerous people working for them, as indicated by the [[Private Room]] chats.

It is known that TTH is a subbranch of some other organization[^2]

It is likely that TTH are the ones responsible for [[The Logs]] being made. This is known because in the livestream chat of [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]], [[INDI]] states that the logs were made by "The [\_\_\_]", which likely refers to TTH. {{discord-cite:cite-mgqph9b7-i941wd}}
