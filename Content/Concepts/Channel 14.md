Channel 14 is a broadcasting channel hosted out of [[Ferkland County]], Nebraska (misspelled as "Nabraska"), which first appeared in [[LOG-40.mp4]]

Whenever this appeared in the STATION_8 livestreams, [[INDI]] would have to "fix it", then the [[Station Interruption]] proceeded after it.

[[SYSTEM]] has revealed that the Channel 14 schedule is used to "keep up when NaN"<!-- discord-cite:cite-mgs1xi27-v10ct8 -->. We do not know what this "NaN" event is, as it was censored by [[SYSTEM]]. On another occasion, [[SYSTEM]] simply stated that the purpose of Channel 14 was for "News, movies, etc."<!-- discord-cite:cite-mgs1zew5-bxccf1 -->.
