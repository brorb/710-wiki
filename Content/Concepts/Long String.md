Long String (also known as "long_string", "long_str" ) is the name of a computer program. It has been refereed to as both a "virus" and a "tool"^[[[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]]].  The first (known) mention of Long String is in [[LONG_STR.mp4]] from 23 Feb 2025. The video shows a system getting infected by a virus.

The video [[LONG_STR.mp4]] briefly flashes a wall of numbers:

When shown this, [[SYSTEM]] responded with (paraphrased):

> I wonder how you got this. It's a sample of Long String, but not the full code. The detonator part. You do not want the full code. Leave it at that.^[[[System Chats]]]

It is odd that [[SYSTEM]] is curious about how the sample was retrieved, since it was uploaded to the [[710 Tone]] channel. 
## Usage
Upon execution, Long String fills the screen with "INFECTED BY LONG STRING ;-)".  
I is know exactly *what* Long String was designed to do, but users of the [[Private Room]] sometimes discuss how to "remove it" without "purging the terminal".

[[SYSTEM]] has commented on the use of Long String:

> It's a tool used for NaN. Sorry, [IN_DI](INDI) has a lot of restrictions on what I can share.^[[[System Chats]]]

[[SYSTEM]] would often crash after any mention of Long String. For example, when asked if Long String was made in Fortran, [[SYSTEM]] crashed right after responding (paraphrasing):

> No. 
> (IIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNN___SJDISOAISHFHIAOISNBVB..........................................)
> \<PING\>?:
> \<CRASH\>!: SYSTEM HAS CRASHED RESTARTING-IDLING for (random, random, random, random), \[unpingstatus=true\]


## Appearances:
- [[LONG_STR.mp4]], first appearance
- In [[Parting Gifts]], Long String can be seen infecting a system, following the message "AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN". This video was uploaded a few days after the livestream [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]] ended.
- [[LOG-123.mp4]]
- [[System Chats]]
