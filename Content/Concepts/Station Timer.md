A timer that always counts down to July 10th of every year, which is apparently an important event for the [[710 Tone]] channel. It appears in [[The Logs]] as a counter and livestreams as the screen shown to the right. During the livestreams, a continuous frequency would play in the background while it counts down.

### Purpose:

The timer's sole purpose is to count down to July 10th annually.

### When the timer started:

In 2025, the Station Timer screen (as seen above) started broadcasting on the "ES-ETA" livestream from June 7th, 2025. However, it has been featured as far back as the "[[30]]" video.

### When the timer ended and what happened afterwards:

In [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]], the timer ended on July 10th at 3:00AM. When it ended, [[INDI]] asked the viewers to enter in a 5-digit code (referred to as "the op code" by [[SYSTEM]]) with the digits being contained in the descriptions of prime numbered logs ([[LOG-002.mp4]], [[LOG-007.mp4]], [[LOG-17.mp4]], [[LOG-31.mp4]], and finally [[LOG-71.mp4]]). The code (28634 when combined) was entered successfully and INDI began a transmission signal, but was overloaded and got found by someone (possibly the mysterious "[[He]]" figure).

### Interferences:

During the STATION_8 livestreams, the timer would be occasionally interrupted by the [[Station Interruption]] screen and [[Channel 14]], which got worse as it was getting closer to the end. These interferences were caused by [[REN]] according to [[INDI]] (see [[STATION_8 TRIM 90]]). Other times there would be interferences preceding some kind of strange noise (glitched tone or anomalous frequencies).

However, not all interferences disrupt the timer completely, there are some instances where other anomalies, such as strange noises or visual glitches, occur while it is still counting down.
