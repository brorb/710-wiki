Possibly a type of signal that the program that makes [[The Logs]] capture data from, as mentioned in the [[Hello]] video. It is an unofficial term according to the owner of the [[710 Tone]] Youtube channel, which seems to suggest that this concept is entirely original and specific to the world of [[710 Tone]].
