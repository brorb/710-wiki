Technical difficulties screen that appeared occasionally during the livestreams (also featured in some of [[The Logs]] as well), usually caused by REN or some other type of interference in signal connection.

The song that plays during it is "Dance of the Hours" by Amilcare Ponchielli[^1] (from the opera "La Gioconda"), specifically the "summer" act of the song. [[ECAA(TEST) CL5672]]
