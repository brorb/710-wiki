The Ferkland Institute is a mysterious organization possibly tied to [[TTH]] (as hinted at in [[LOG-15.mmp44]]). Their purpose is unknown as if now (the time of writing this is October 17th, 2025).

_Logo deduction by The Sleuths._

Their logo has only appeared once, in [[LOG-10444444444444444444444]], with the text "FUNDED DEATH" branded on top. The meaning of this is not understood.
