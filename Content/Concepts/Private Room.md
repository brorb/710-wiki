TRANSCRIPT 001:
TTH: F2930 We see your signal, transferring in a bit. Hold tight.

TRANSCRIPT 002:
TTH: F2930 Your signal will be sent in 1100, by your time that will be 2200
F2930: Why is there a wait time?
TTH: Difficulties with some Datacores and CIN Centers, but it that will be resolved soon.

TRANSCRIP 003:
TTH: F2930, we encountered some anomalous interference with your signal
F2930: THEN FIX IT.
TTH: F2930, This matter is on your part.
F2930: SORRY, THEN I'LL FIX IT.
TTH: Then just send the serial code back and we'll get you back on it.
F2930: YEAH, WHAT'S A SERIAL CODE?
TTH: The code from the signal generation key.

TRANSCRIPT 004:
TTH: F2930, We're getting some REN signals. Do you have anything to explain that?
F2930: WHAT DO YOU MEAN REN SIGNALS?
TTH: Don't play dumb, we're going to have to search your terminal before we can allow you to pass through.
F2930: NO, WAIT! I DON'T CONTRIBUTE WITH REN!
TTH: Don't worry F2930. If we find nothing then you can pass through, but if you are hiding something then we will have to do something about that.

TRANSCRIPT 005:
TTH: Okay, we went through everything and found nothing. It is suspicious however, that your terminal is completely clean of anything, but it's whatever. We just have to monitor your signals for 3 - 6 days and we will conclude whether or not we'll allow your signals to continue being private.
F2930: Come on, I'm not even going to have that district for that long, can't we do something to make your head turn the other way?
TTH: What are you implying?
F2930: Nothing, just I have 2000 Credit somewhere. I'll tell you where it is if you let my signal go through without monitoring it.
TTH: I'm sorry, but I can\<INSERT S PROTECTED CODE>'t take bribes.
F2930: I see, what a shame, well it's near\<INSERT LAN CORD EXPUNGED AFTER 0432 AM>
