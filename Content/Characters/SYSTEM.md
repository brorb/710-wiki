_SYSTEM_ (also known as *SYSTEMterminal8*, *system000008*) is a program created by [[INDI]].

Originally, SYSTEM was created as a moderator of the [[Livestreams]], but quickly grew to be a central lore character, when they joined the [[The Sleuths]] Discord channel. Here, they were able to talk with [[The Sleuths]] directly. These interactions have served as some of the most important sources of lore information.

## Discord Messages
On the 19th July 2025, SYSTEM joined the [Discord server](710 Tone Sleuths) after @brorb sent an invite link to the email terminal8sbc@gmail.com (who was the uploader of the file [[vacsystemrestart.mp3]]). 
Server members were confused as to how interpret the messages, but eventually they discovered that they could use [[SYSTEM]] as a terminal (perhaps the reason why they are also called SYSTEMterminal8) to type commands in order to navigate a rudimentary file hierarchy:

	\<HELP>!:=============[help menu]=============
	<HELP>!:help = 0-
	<HELP>!:TERMINAL_Storage4u = 1-
	<HELP>!:Back = 2-
Users would then reply with "0-", "1-", "2-", etc., to navigate the file system. This navigation was, however, not frictionless, as SYSTEM would frequently crash, causing SYSTEM to remain unresponsive for a random amount of time, following the message: 

> \<CALL\>!: !ERROR! \[REQUESTS EXTENDED BEYOND LIMIT\]-IDLING for (random, random, random, random), \[unpingstatus=true\]

### IN_DI Message

_Example of the TERMINAL\_Storage4u command menu._

Upon querying "1-" within the TERMINAL_Storage4u menu, [[The Sleuths]] received [[INDI]]'s message:

> HELLO, IF YOU GOT THIS, IT'S BECAUSE OF A FAIL SAFE I INSTALLED ONTO THE MOD BEFORE THE SYSTEM WAS TERMINATED. IT IS CAPABLE OF DOING ONLY ONE THING, AND THAT IS TO GIVE YOU THIS MESSAGE IF IT WAS PINGED BY SOMEONE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN PING THE MOD, BUT IT HAS JUST ENOUGH DATA FROM ME TO KNOW THAT IT'S YOU. HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT DELETES ITSELF AFTER. OH WELL, HERE'S A CLUE IF YOU'RE STUCK. IT'S NOT A NUMBER, BUT A SEQUENCE THAT'S USING SOMETHING BACKWARDS. I HOPE THIS HELPS.

This message gave [[The Sleuths]] two key insights:
1. A clue to the [[Parting Gifts Puzzle]] was that it involved a "backwards sequence" of some kind
2. The SYSTEM Discord user was created by [[INDI]] to interact with [[The Sleuths]]

### Gift
Upon querying "2-" within the TERMINAL_Storage4u menu, SYSTEM sent 6 audio files:
[[01.wav]], [[02.wav]], [[03.wav]], [[04.wav]], [[05.wav]], [[06.wav]].
