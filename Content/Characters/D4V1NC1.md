An alias that appeared in the description of RIGfunctionobservationTEST028. It is currently unknown who this alias really belongs to, but it could be related to the "backtone" videos (see [[backtone.extend 5_f''5.5'']] and [[BACKTONE-COMPLETED{KPJV, ETSN, YMUK, WWEV}]]), which are in turn related to [[Travis]] (since the [[prj_Home.exe]] file was his creation before he died). However, it could also be whoever the elusive "[[He]]" figure is judging by the hidden audio clues of [[HIS PERCEPTION]].

## Leonardo da Vinci
"D4V1NC1" is clearly a rewrite of "da Vinci", likely referring to the renaissance scientist [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci). This follows the trope of characters with aliases of famous scientists, like [[Kepler]]. Da Vinci has also appeared in the video [[backtone.extend 5_f''5.5'']]:

The image of DaVinci fills the screen for a couple of seconds, before the camera pans away to more red room. The text "QUANDO NATUS EST" appears along with a heavily distorted voice reading it aloud. The phrase is classical Latin and means "When was he born", likely referring to Leonardo DaVinci, who was born April 15, 1452.
