REN is the name (or alias) of someone that both [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] work under.

REN seems to be a taboo topic for the 7/10 characters to talk about, keeping any information regarding them confidential.

During the STATION_8 livestreams, INDI was tasked with sending out REN signals, which was being kept under wraps by someone within TTH (possibly Kepler, judging INDI saying that he "solved the problem with TTH", via bribed them with credits).

It is possible that TTH and REN might be rivals.
