_REN_ is the name (or alias) of someone that both [[INDI]] and [[Kepler]] work under.

REN seems to be a taboo topic for the 7/10 characters to talk about, keeping any information regarding them confidential.

During the STATION_8 livestreams, INDI was tasked with sending out REN signals, which was being kept under wraps thanks to an informant within TTH (possibly Kepler, judging by INDI saying that he "solved the problem with TTH", via bribed them with credits to not monitor the signal broadcast).
