"Mr. Forest" was the alias for an unknown person. In [[STATION_8 TRIM 90]], [[INDI]] says that Mr. Forest was "someone who is now gone", not dead but "somewhere far away", which seems to suggest that they are in hiding.

However,  they could possibly be dead by now according to [[SYSTEM]], judging by their text file containing "status:dead". The cause of their death remains unclear.
