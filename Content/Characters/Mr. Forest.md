"Mr. Forest" was the alias for an unknown character, who was apparently prominent during 2024. In [[STATION_8 TRIM 90]], [[INDI]] says that Mr. Forest was "someone who is now gone", not dead but "somewhere far away". However, they could possibly be dead by now according to [[SYSTEM]], judging by their text file containing "status:dead". The cause of their death remains unclear.
