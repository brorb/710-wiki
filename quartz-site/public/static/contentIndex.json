They seem kind-hearted an willing to help.

SYSTEM immediately becomes problematic—it connects to the Private Room and begins pulling data, alarming Kepler. INDI fixes SYSTEM to prevent it from accessing sensitive information, but the moderator continues to malfunction throughout the stream.  INDI and Kepler acknowledge that Long String is a “tool”, and INDI warns viewers that it won’t work for them.\nSYSTEM later gets hijacked by He—a malicious entity that INDI immediately recognizes with fear. The compromised moderator reveals critical information: the usernames of those logged into the Private Room (IN_DI.SERVERTYPE, K3P13R, SYSTEMterminal8, and data_messagesystem05). This breach causes significant alarm, with Kepler furiously demanding INDI shut down the moderator.\nIn the hours that follow, Kepler occasionally takes control of the 710 Tone account when INDI is occupied with “critical tasks”. Both characters mention Travis multiple times—he has locked various controls to prevent INDI from “doing anything stupid,” and apparently hid something important meant for public knowledge.\nAs the countdown approaches zero, INDI and Kepler increase power for signal transfer. INDI mentions they are “piercing through” something. When the countdown ends, viewers receive a prompt:\nHello Again. You remember my promise, right? All I need is a 5 digit code. Look back into the logs to find it. They will be in descriptions of prime numbered logs.\n\nThe community quickly solves this, entering 28634 into chat. The screen fills with static, displaying “I FOUND YOU INDI” before the stream ends. Videos KEY and lm-1 are subsequently posted.\n\nMain Events\n\nSYSTEM (SYSTEMterminal8) is created by INDI as a chat moderator\nSYSTEMconnects to Private Room, alarming Kepler\nLong String is acknowledged as a tool used by INDI and Kepler\nINDI mentions trying to remove security but not meaning to hurt “it”\nSYSTEM reveals R5-REQUEST protocol (can delete entire livestream)\nHe hijacks SYSTEMand speaks through it, terrifying INDI\nSYSTEM leaks Private Room usernames: IN_DI.SERVERTYPE, K3P13R, data_messagesystem05\nKepler takes control of 710 Tone account multiple times\nDiscussion of Travis having locked controls and hidden important information\nPower increased for signal transfer as countdown approaches zero\nCountdown reaches 0:00\nPrompt appears requesting 5-digit code from prime-numbered logs\nCommunity enters code 28634\n“I FOUND YOU INDI” appears on screen\nStream ends; videos KEY and lm-1 are posted\n"},"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8-TERMINAL-8/Transcript":{"slug":"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8-TERMINAL-8/Transcript","filePath":"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8 TERMINAL 8/Transcript.md","title":"Transcript","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7/10NPP: I told you.  7/10 Tone: DAMN IT.  7/10 Tone: FIXED.  7/10NPP: Thanks indi.AmeraM: goodbye  AmeraM: delogitechter  AmeraM: It was a beautiful program  Terrarium: Bro what is this  Terrarium: My recommendations are crazy right now tf  AnonymousUser: cookening?  7/10 Tone: ONLY 2 DAYS LEFT?

During the chaos, 710 Tone reveals their true identity as INDI. INDI provides crucial information about Mr. Forest being an alias for someone who has relocated far away, and reveals that Ferkland County is the location of the channel in “Nabraska” (misspelled Nebraska). Discussing Ferkland County causes INDI physical pain. Throughout the stream, INDI struggles with signal management while Kepler (operating as 710 NPP) monitors and attempts to keep INDI from communicating with viewers. The conversation touches on TTH as a “problem” Kepler has already solved and that they must keep INDI “in check” to prevent rogue signals to ESPaP stations. NPP cryptically explains that INDI’s name should be parsed as “IN_DI” and describes them as “close” to a robot but not quite. Viewers reference a mysterious file (~500 bytes) that INDI warns against obtaining. Chat security becomes compromised, leading INDI to restart the livestream despite Kepler’s protests.\nKey Events\n\nStream restarts due to REN\nEntity identifies themselves as INDI, rejecting “7/10 Tone” designation\nMr. Forest confirmed as alias for someone relocated far away (not dead/killed)\nFerkland County revealed as channel location in “Nabraska” [misspelled]\nDiscussion of Ferkland causes INDI physical pain\nINDI experiences ongoing signal management difficulties\nKepler’s involvement with TTH solution confirmed\n7/10NPP warns INDI about “He” discovering their activities\n7/10NPP clarifies relationship: not parental figure, but monitors INDI to prevent rogue ESPaP signals\nINDI’s nature hinted at through name parsing: “IN_DI” (close to robot)\nMysterious ~500 byte file referenced; INDI warns viewers against obtaining it\nINDI accidentally reveals Kepler’s alias\nChat security compromised, prompting livestream restart\n"},"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8-TRIM-90/Transcript":{"slug":"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8-TRIM-90/Transcript","filePath":"YouTube/Livestreams/STATION_8 TRIM 90/Transcript.md","title":"Transcript","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRORIGIN: 7/10 Tone, why did you restart the stream? was it due to REN?  7/10 Tone: STOP CALLING ME THAT, AND YES.

According to the owner, the channel uploads LOGs from a program that is designed to pull data from “Caper Waves” (unofficial term), which could possibly be a type of signal or radio wave. They are ordered by someone to make the program and upload the videos to the channel for an unknown purpose, keeping things very secret as to what the purpose of it is and exactly who the mysterious people are that force them to do this. They ask the viewers to make the channel go viral before signing off. The video then cuts to the number 100, which quickly scans through numbers and morphs into the number 099. Then a distorted old-timey song plays in the background while a “LINX-OS TERMINAL 8” screen (similar to MS-DOS) appears onscreen, which loads some LOG output and tries to send the data to the C: drive, but errors out due to limited storage space, then someone attempts to mount an “E” drive, removing the C: drive, but the “E” drive also has low storage as well.\nTranscript:\nHello\nThe 7/10 Tone Channel\nI see you.\n(Shows a ton of comments)\nAll of you.\nYou where recommended this channel.\nAnd rightfully have some questions.\nNo, I’m not him.\nNo, I’m not REN.\nNo, I do not make the logs, but I do upload them.\nYes, this is the real channel owner.\nI am not a corporate entity or organization looking to recruit people.\nI don’t like to get involved with this channel, but the recent 100+ sub count has made me concerned for where it is going.\nSo…\nWhat is 7/10 Tone exactly?\n7/10 Tone is a program that is disigned to pull data from Caper Waves (Not official term).\nDon’t get it?\nMe neither.\nI did not design the program, I was told to make it by someone.\nThose people won’t be named.\nSo, why do I upload these to YouTube?\nThe 7/10 Tone program runs on an external computer that records and stores the logs.\nThis can take up a lot of space, more than 1TB of I kept them all.\nSo, I asked if I can modify the program so it would upload to youtube instead, and they agreed.\nThat is why you’re seeing them being posted to the 7/10 Tone channel.\nIf, you found this channel by accident, congratulations, you have the strangest YouTube algorithm known to man.\nBut, I need you to do something.\nAll of you.\nI need you to unsubscribe to this channel.\n(Message gets edited quickly)\nI need you to subscribe and share this channel.\n(Message gets edited again crudely)\nI need you to make this channel viral.\nI hope you can understand why.\nAnd with that, goodbye for now.\n(Single frame flashes quickly with glitchy artifacts, translated from reverse)\nYOUR NOT IN CONTROL HERE (with The Eyes in the bottom corner of the screen)"},"YouTube/Videos/7-10-Tone/HIS-PERCEPTION":{"slug":"YouTube/Videos/7-10-Tone/HIS-PERCEPTION","filePath":"YouTube/Videos/7-10 Tone/HIS PERCEPTION.md","title":"HIS PERCEPTION","links":["Characters/He","Characters/D4V1NC1"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n_Uploaded 16 Sept 2025._\nVideo Summary: Deep scary noises play over some static with a red tint, a TV broadcast test screen pops up occasionally as well.

contrast video quality, red and black static starts out as normal until a mouse cursor briefly flies across towards the top right corner of the screen, then a blue bar with nearly indecipherable text pops up on the very top of the screen while a soft screechy tone plays in the background over the rest of the static. The mouse cursor can be seen occasionally around the right side of the screen. Timer counts down from 098 to 097, the number “7” in 097 repeats itself, going diagonally downwards on the screen, which cuts out to red with some data noise.\nClues: It seems like whoever is in charge of the program that makes The Logs tried to “feed” it some kind of data, judging by what little could be deciphered from the blue bar’s text: ”(?????) (?????)

The Eyes appear in the bottom corner of the screen while the computer program loads and tracks data (misspelled as “TRAKING”) before the chatroom finally connects. Two characters with the IDs A992144 and X331239 speak to each other, with the latter sternly reprimanding “A” for being irresponsible and almost costing them “a mission” of some kind. There is mention of an “incident” involving a station (possibly a radio station) that has gone rogue (possibly infected by Long String or some other virus) and was attempting to call another station and send out frequencies to neighboring resivers. The rest of the video plays out like a normal log, the Station Timer counts down from 168 to 167 (with a vertical and horizonal line of zeros forming around the numbers).\nTranscript of the SPR chatlog:\n==X331239: ABOUT TIME YOU SIGNALED US\nA992144: HEY, WE&#039;RE WORKING ON IT\nX331239: YOU&#039;RE NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH\nA992144: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?\nX331239: ANYTIME YOU TURN ON THAT STATION, IT GOES TO SHIT AND SEND OUT FREQUENCIES TO ANY NEIGHBOTING RESIVER NOW I DONT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT YOU AND YOUR BOYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SENDING OUT INFORMATION NOT TRYING TO CALL OTHER STATIONS\nA992144: ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT&#039;S OUT FAULT FOR THAT INCIDENT?\nX331239: NO WE&#039;RE SAYING THAT YOU NEED TO GET THAT STATION UNDER CONTROL OR WE ARE TERMINATING THE MISSION\nA992144:== WE’LL TRY"}}
