INDI (or *IN_DI*) is the name of the entity[^1]running the [[YouTube/710 Tone]].  
  
The moniker “7/10” is carried by at least two characters: 7/10 Tone and 7/10 NPP. The “7/10” is a date (10th July) written in an american date format. This corresponds to the date which the countdowns were counting down to, and also to the profile picture of the 7/10 Tone YouTube channel (see image to the left). We do not know why this date is of significance. There are reasons to believe that this is a yearly event that has been going on for at least two years

  
## Name

Their official name is "IN_DI", as confirmed by [Kepler/710 NPP](Kepler.md) in a YouTube livestream.  Viewers of the stream were asked to "Think about why his name is INDI or more IN_DI". The true meaning behind INDI's name is not understood. 

Sparsely, INDI has been named "IN_DI.SERVERTYPE" (or something adjacent), as seen in the description of  [LOG-109.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LDiAWJQSOI), in the livestream chats of [[STATION_8 TERMINAL 8]] and [[LOG-132]].


## Personality
INDI always types in [upper case letters](Livestreams/Transcripts).  They seem kind-hearted an willing to help. INDI has, through [livestream chats](/Livestream/Transcripts) on the [7/10 Tone channel](YouTube Channel), been one of the main sources of lore insight, often quickly followed by a reprimand by [[Kepler]]. Their relationship with Kepler seems to be that of an employee to a supervisor. 

On several occasions, INDI has stated that they are “not in control here” and that they are just a cog in the grand machine.
