**Video Summary:** A beep-like noise plays while some glitched checkerboards (red, green, and blue respectively) melts on the screen, the shape of a TV broadcast test screen forms with the blue checkerboard, then it cuts to black with the words ",,,<,CH_B1>TERMINATED" on the top corner of the screen.

**Clues:** In the spectrogram of the video's audio at around 46 seconds in, there looks to be a shape that's similar to the House building in [[prj_Home.exe]].
