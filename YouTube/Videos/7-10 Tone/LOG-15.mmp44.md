**LOG: 689248189
SYSTEM: 578309
SYSTEM ID: 029826371**

**Video Summary:** LOG data screen is wavier and lasts for about 2-3 seconds, normal red and black static plays, timer counts down from 143 to 142 but the number 2 in "142" gets repeated and a "2" appears in the front making it "2142222222222", then the glitches out with a distorted red checkboard background and some blurry zoomed-in images until it ends.

**Clues:** During the red checkerboard part, there are some numbers that flash on-screen that are covered by the black squares. The [[TTH]] logo and a part of [[The Institute]] also appear in the bottom left corner of the screen, which could mean that The Institute is involved with TTH (or the other way around).
