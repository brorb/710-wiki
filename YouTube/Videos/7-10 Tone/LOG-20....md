**((CORRUPTED LOG DATA))**

**Video Summary:** LOG data screen is glitched, horizonal lines dance around the screen throughout the video. Normal red and black static, timer morphs from 130 to 171 then counts down to 170 while strange beeping noises play in the background.

**Clues:** The timer change could be a clue to some kind of code or something. It also happens in [[LOG-32.mp4]], [[LOG-41.mp4]], [[machina_ad_mortem.mp4]], [[LOG-71.mp4]], [[Hello]], [[LOG-111.mp4]], [[log-131.mp4]], and [[LOG-141.mp4]].
