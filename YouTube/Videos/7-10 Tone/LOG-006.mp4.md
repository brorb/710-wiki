**LOG: 759300174
SYSTEM: 931654
SYSTEM ID: 563928
SYSTEM STATUS: (ok)**

**Video Summary:** Normal red and black static, timer counts down from 153 to 152, ominous noises in the background.

**Clues:** Much like in the previous LOGs ([[LOG-002.mp4]], [[LOG-003.mp4]], [[LOG-004.mp4]], and [[LOG-005.mp4]]), the timer's background noise is actually a slowed down piano cord, except this time it is both in reverse and forward.
