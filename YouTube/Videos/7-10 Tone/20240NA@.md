**Video Summary:** Garbled text types on-screen while some frequencies and Chinese(?) speech play in the background, the text "IMPERFECT VALUE: REDO IT" appears in intervals through the process. At the very end of the video, there are two antenna connected to each other with some low-pitched beeps, and for a split second a skull and a red line in between to two connecting antennas appear on-screen before the video ends.
