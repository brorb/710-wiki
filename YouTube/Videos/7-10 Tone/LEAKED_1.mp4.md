###### Video Summary:
---
The video starts with some colorful static and low-pitched noise, then cuts to the following text:
**SERVICE LOG #8829: TAKEN FROM TTH BASE #13. THE LOG IS AN OVERVIEW AT HOW '[[INDI]]' WAS ABLE TO PRESUADED AN INDIVIDUAL TO DOWNLOAD A FILE THAT PINGED THEIR PLC LOCATION. DESTROYING ANOTHER P.E.**

TTH logo appears at the bottom corner for a split second before more text appears on-screen:
**INDI'S "TRUTH.ZIP" 001:
CONTAINED: (FALSE)
TYPE: MALICIOUS, PERSISTENT, SILENT
NOTES: THE PERFECT WEAPON AGAINST OLDER TECHNOLOGY

Cut to Google Chrome browser with a homepage that has links to YouTube, Amazon, and three other sites that are hard to make out due to the poor quality of the video. The cursor clicks on the Google Chrome menu, to which we can see the account button with the letter "S" as the Profile picture (indicating that the account owner's name starts with an S). The cursor lingers on the "Google Search" button for a while before clicking on the YouTube link on the homepage, which brings the browser over to a shady looking website that is mostly black with a tiny "click me" button (the URL is also censored out with a black bar). When the cursor clicks the button, a robotic voice starts talking (most likely INDI):

"HELLO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DOWNLOAD A FILE?"

The website changes to have a tiny "DOWNLOAD" button with the text "DOWNLOAD HERE" pointing to the button below. The voice continues:

"IT WILL MAKE YOUR COMPUTER FASTER THAN A QUANTUM COMPUTER. AND IT HAS SOME ✨*TASTY*✨ SECRETS FROM THE PENTAGON. SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD MY FILE."

The cursor hesitates for a moment before ultimately clicking the button, which prompts the browser to immediately download a "TRUTH.ZIP" file. The voice finishes with: "IT WILL BE A SECRET BETWEEN US. HAVE A GOOD DAY." before it redirects back to normal YouTube.

**NOTES:
CONTINUE TO OBSERVE. DO NOT INTERFERE WITH INDI UNTIL AUTHORIZED.

Same colored static as before (except flipped) plays as the video ends.

###### Clues:
---
The audio during the static is the same as the audio from the program in [[LOG-116.mp4]] except slowed down.
