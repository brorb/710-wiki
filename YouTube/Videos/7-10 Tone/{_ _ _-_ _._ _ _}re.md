**LOG: 046192883
SYSTEM: 642895
SYSTEM ID: 748302948**

**Video Summary:** Starts as a regular LOG before the black and red static cuts off and a dial tone plays for about 2 minutes until it connects to a computer program requesting access to a chatroom (called the SPR Chat). [[The Eyes]] appear in the bottom corner of the screen while the computer program loads and tracks data (misspelled as "TRAKING") before the chatroom finally connects. Two characters with the IDs [[A992144]] and [[X331239]] speak to each other, with the latter sternly reprimanding "A" for being irresponsible and almost costing them "a mission" of some kind. There is mention of an "incident" involving a station (possibly a radio station) that has gone rogue (possibly infected by [[Long String]] or some other virus) and was attempting to call another station and send out frequencies to neighboring resivers. The rest of the video plays out like a normal log, the [[Station Timer]] counts down from 168 to 167 (with a vertical and horizonal line of zeros forming around the numbers).
