This is the summary of the livestream "STATION_8 TRIM 90", from July 4th 2025

## Summary

The livestream experiences technical difficulties and restarts due to [[REN]]. During the chaos, [[710 Tone]] reveals their true identity as [[INDI]]. [[INDI]] provides crucial information about [[Mr. Forest]] being an alias for someone who has relocated far away, and reveals that [[Ferkland County]] is the location of the channel in "Nabraska" (misspelled Nebraska). Discussing [[Ferkland County]] causes [[INDI]] physical pain. Throughout the stream, [[INDI]] struggles with signal management while [[Kepler]] (operating as [[710 NPP]]) monitors and attempts to keep [[INDI]] from communicating with viewers. The conversation touches on [[TTH]] as a "problem" [[Kepler]] has already solved and that they must keep [[INDI]] "in check" to prevent rogue signals to ESPaP stations. NPP cryptically explains that [[INDI]]'s name should be parsed as "IN_DI" and describes them as "close" to a robot but not quite. Viewers reference a mysterious file (~500 bytes) that [[INDI]] warns against obtaining. Chat security becomes compromised, leading [[INDI]] to restart the livestream despite [[Kepler]]'s protests.
